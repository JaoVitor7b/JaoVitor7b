## Hi there 👋

<!--
**JaoVitor7b/JaoVitor7b** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

🔭 I’m currently working on Java projects and front-end development using HTML and CSS.

🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript and how to build responsive web interfaces.

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on web development projects or open-source Java applications.

🤔 I’m looking for help with connecting front-end designs with back-end logic.

💬 Ask me about HTML, CSS, and Java basics.

📫 How to reach me: www.linkedin.com/in/joão-vitor-rosa-028506308

😄 Pronouns: [he/him]

🎮🎨 Fun fact: I love diving into coding challenges — whether it's debugging for hours or crafting game mechanics and visuals, I completely lose track of time!
