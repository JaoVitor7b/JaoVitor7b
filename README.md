## Hi there 👋

Here are some ideas to get you started:

🔭 I’m currently working on Java projects and front-end development using HTML and CSS. ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9285aacc-17f3-4292-b8d9-fb8dda57c753)


🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript and how to build responsive web interfaces.

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on web development projects or open-source Java applications.

🤔 I’m looking for help with connecting front-end designs with back-end logic.

💬 Ask me about HTML, CSS, and Java basics.

🎮🎨 Fun fact: I love diving into coding challenges — whether it's debugging for hours or crafting game mechanics and visuals, I completely lose track of time!
