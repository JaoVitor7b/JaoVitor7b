## Hi there 👋

Here are some ideas to get you started:

🔭 I’m currently working on Java projects and front-end development using HTML and CSS.  ![css-3 (2)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/38799e5f-95fa-46b9-af10-017337b8850b)



🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript and how to build responsive web interfaces.  ![js](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c3b7cab0-e811-4b39-a6b9-3a5a03d57ec0)


👯 I’m looking to collaborate on web development projects or open-source Java applications.

🤔 I’m looking for help with connecting front-end designs with back-end logic.

💬 Ask me about HTML, CSS, and Java basics.
